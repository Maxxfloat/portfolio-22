    "description": "web developer by React. I started coding in high school, and the first language I learned was c++, I chose the web because it is easy to use and accessible on every device. I see a bright future for web apps and want to be part of this future. Likewise, I started learning the required skills through online courses. After a few months of practice and several training projects, I worked with other developers (junior and senior) to get teamwork experience. Now I am looking to work remotely or locally with a creative and ethical team in the role of React Developer"
